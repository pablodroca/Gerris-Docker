03/04/2006: Release 0.4.2

- Bug fix for gtk-2.8 handling of "client events".
- New "Clipping" object for 3D clipping planes.
- Reorganised objects in a new "Objects" menu.
- Serious bug fix for isolines levels parsing.
- Debian snapshots.

17/10/2005: Release 0.4

Important changes and new features:

- (Tidal) ellipse display
- GfsOutputLocation display
- Embedded boundaries are represented as they are seen by Gerris
(i.e. resolution dependent).
- Embedded boundaries and isosurfaces can be coloured according to a scalar.
- "Substract" function.
- Visualisations can be saved/restored.
- GfsView is scriptable and multithreaded (i.e. reads and reacts to
standard input instructions).
- Batch mode version of GfsView does not need an openGL display. This
is useful for offline image/animation generation.
- More general input of scalars: functions (e.g. U/10, sin(U+V)
etc...) can be specified directly.
- GfsView objects can be "picked". This is used to implement display of
pointer 3D positions and scalar values etc... (hold control key to activate picking)
- Streamlines 2D and 3D with interactive selection of seed points.
- Automatic evenly-spaced streamline generation in 2D.

20/10/2004: Release 0.2.0

This is the first "official" release of GfsView. It's still a bit
rough around the edges but one can already do quite a bit with it:

- Isosurfaces
- Arbitrary cut planes
- Efficient use of the octree data structure for fast computation and
  display
- High-quality Postscript and PDF output

The main bugs currently are:

- A (very) limited number of "derived variables" (e.g. Vorticity,
  Velocity, Lambda2 etc..) are currently allowed
- Some Z-buffer openGL issues

Desirable missing features include:

- Streamlines
- Volume visualisation
